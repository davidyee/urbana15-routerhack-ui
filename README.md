========================================

The main index file is present in the `Content` folder. This web page is responsive in design; it works in both mobile and desktop environments using the Bootstrap framework.

The index page is intended to be simple in design with no words. The intention is to convey the three resource types: audio, text, and video content without requiring translation so that the web page can be used by people from various languages and cultures.

In the desktop mode of the web page, the three resources are represented horizontally as icons. In the mobile mode of the web page, the three resources icons tile so that they are displayed vertically.
